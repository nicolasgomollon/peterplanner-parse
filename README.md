# peterplanner-parse

PeterPlanner is a course prerequisite tracker and scheduling tool for UCI students.

This is the script that deals with parsing the content downloaded with the [peterplanner-download](https://github.com/nicolasgomollon/peterplanner-download) script, and generating a single `catalogue.json` file containing all of the necessary information for every course at UCI.
